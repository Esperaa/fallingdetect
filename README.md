Version 2.0
###### The fundamental appearance remains unchanged, while the improvements to the device mainly include the following aspects:

- ###### A protective plastic pad has been added to the rear side of the circuit board to prevent impacts and safeguard the rear circuitry.
- ######  The initial placement position of Version1.0 has been eliminated; detection will now be based on the position after power activation (thus enhancing usability).‚Ä©
- ######  The delay in sending alarm notifications has been canceled, allowing for immediate alarming message sending. The cancellation button is now solely designated for silencing the buzzer alarm and restarting the program.
